It is a simple boiler plate project for using the combination of [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga).

This application simply lands in a login page, and user can enter username and password to land in his profile screen. Application typically concentrated on understanding the flow of data in react and redux. [Side effects (asynchronous operations)](https://redux.js.org/docs/faq/Actions.html#actions-side-effects) are handled by saga. So kept the project as simple as possible, there is no fancy ui and only minimal node modules included for start development with this tech stack.

Node modules used - 

 1. axios
 2. react
 3. react-native
 4. react-navigation
 5. react-redux
 6. redux
 7. redux-saga
